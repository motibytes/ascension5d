How do I move the blog to another page instead of having it on the home page?
The default style of Beautiful Jekyll is to feature the blog feed on the front page. But for many sites that's not the ideal structure, and you may want to have a separate dedicated page for the blog posts.
 To have the blog hosted on a different URL (for example at <mysite.com>/blog),
 copy the index.html file into a folder with the same name as the desired page
 (for example, to blog/index.html), and in the _config.yml file
 you need to add a parameter paginate_path: 
 "/<page name>/page:num/" (for example paginate_path: "/blog/page:num/").
